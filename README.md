# Recurrent Trend Predictive Network with Application to Multi-Sensor Fire Detection

This repository contains the codes of the Keras implementation of the Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network (rTPNN) model, as well as an example for the multi-sensor fire detection in the folder CrossValidationOnFireDataset.


# Citation Request
The rTPNN as well as its application on multi-sensor fire detection has been published as a journal paper which is entitled as "Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network for Multi-Sensor Fire Detection" on IEEE Access.
