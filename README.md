# Recurrent Trend Predictive Network with Application to Multi-Sensor Fire Detection

This repository contains your codes of the Keras implementation of the Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network (rTPNN) model, as well as an example for the multi-sensor fire detection.

Since the content of this repository (including rTPNN and multi-sensor fire detection together) has been submitted to IEEE Access for possible publication under the title of "Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network for Multi-Sensor Fire Detection", the detailed explanation of the rTPNN model and the considered application will be provided later.
